(Important: Make sure to install this latest version of ComfyUI Frontend - **1.25.0**!!!)

A demonstration custom node that showcases how to integrate Vue as a frontend framework within ComfyUI, complete with PrimeVue components and vue-i18n support.

## Overview

ComfyUI Frontend Vue Basic provides a working example of how to build interactive UI components for ComfyUI custom nodes using modern web technologies. It features a basic drawing board inside a custom node that outputs the created image as a result.

## Features

- Interactive drawing board within a custom node
- Modern UI components with PrimeVue
- Multi-language support via vue-i18n
- Integration with ComfyUI's API system

## Installation
